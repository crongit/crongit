If MAILTO is defined (and non-empty), mail is sent to the specified address. If MAILTO is defined but empty (MAILTO=), no mail is sent. Otherwise, mail is sent to the owner of the crontab. This option is useful if you decide to use /bin/mail instead of /usr/lib/sendmail as your mailer. Note that /bin/mail does not provide aliasing and UUCP usually does not read its mail. If MAILFROM is defined (and non-empty), it is used as the envelope sender address, otherwise, ``root'' is used.

Different character encodings can be used for mailing cron job outputs by setting the CONTENT_TYPE and CONTENT_TRANSFER_ENCODING variables in a crontab to the correct values of the mail headers of those names.
